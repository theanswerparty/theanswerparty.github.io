			<h3 class="header"> Immigration</h3>
			<p class="text"> The world is a big place with lots of people moving from place to place. Unfortunately, current border and immigration policies have fallen behind the times. Based on times when the world was less-than-open, our immigration laws are harsh with little rationale for their details. We intend to put less aggressive border policies in place. In fact, an open-border policy just might be what this nation needs. Without the walls, fences, and screening at airports the amount of money spent on immigration would become virtually nothing, saving upwards of $18 billion every year (Miron, 2018). This means a few things for the hopeful individuals that want to enter the United States. Immigrants will be able to enter the country more safely and without being harassed. In addition to this, we will provide resources for new immigrants so they can hit the ground running with some of the extra money. Many people come to America for the American dream and we seek to facilitate that process as much as possible. Some worry that an open-border policy will cause a massive influx of immigrants. Donald Trump even passed legislation for a concrete border wall in which he directed $8.1 billion towards, though it was changed to be a steel barrier by Democratic request (Ballotpedia, 2019). This worry is falsely founded. Since immigrants can re-immigrate they are less likely to settle and will move between the US and their mother country every few years, alternating between working, studying, and time with their family (Miron, 2018). An open-border policy where the United States is a welcoming environment would be good for immigrants, their families, and for us.</p>

			<h3 class="header"> Mental Health</h3>
			<p class="text"> Taking care of the mentally ill should be of high priority in this nation. Often, the focus is on the mitigating effects of an issue and not preventing the causes. Nearly 40,000 Americans take their own lives each year, with nine out of ten cases being related to a mental health issue (Lichtenwald, 2016). In addition to this, on average, adults with serious mental illness die 25 years earlier than the general population (NAMI, 2019, “Treatment”). We will provide services and aid to the people who need them at zero or reduced cost. These can include therapy, prescriptions, and methods of rehabilitation for those who need them. All people deserve to have a level of care that keeps them and the people around them safe. According to Lichtenwald, “Two-thirds of primary care physicians are unable to find a mental health professional to care for their patients after diagnosis (2016). Increasing availability would be the first step in a long road for the nation’s recovery. As stated by NAMI, “[...] every person with a serious mental illness is entitled to the same level of service afforded other physical illnesses” (2019). Unfortunately, mental health services were reduced by a value of $5 billion from 2009 to 2012 (Lichtenwald, 2016). Undoing these backwards steps is essential, and we have a plan for regaining that money. This will tie into our policy of Gun Control with more rigorous background checks and monetised mental health assessments to ensure dangerous weapons do not fall into the hands of dangerous people. While funding would occur on a national scale, a locally tailored solution would be preferable to a large-scale application. Mental health policy requires the consideration of contextual factors such as culture, religion, as well as severity of mental disorders. (Jenkins, 2003). This division of policy ensures that the system remains balanced for individual regions and is not radically changed when it would be against the interests of the affected.</p>

			<h3 class="header"> Environment</h3>
			<p class="text"> We promote clean energy and the idea that action must be taken to slow down and/or reverse the effects of climate change. 63% of the United States still has its electricity provided by fossil fuels (Union of Concerned Scientists, 2019). This number must go down. We can start with tax hikes for fossil fuels and the unclean energy sector. “Carbon pricing” policies such as this incentivise a move away from unclean energy, though they can be difficult to make effective and require collaboration with impacted communities (Union of Concerned Scientists, 2019, “Energy Solutions”). While doing this, we will provide additional incentives for renewable energy and assist those in the fossil fuel industry in transitioning towards work with cleaner alternatives. There are a number of these, including solar, wind, geothermal, and bioenergy (Energy.gov). These fields in the clean energy sector can provide up to 3.26 million jobs. This is nearly three times the total amount of jobs in the US fossil fuel industry at 1.15 million (E2.org, 2019). This indicates that a complete transition to clean energy is entirely feasible and should be pursued, especially considering that, according to E2.org, “More than 85% of Americans [...] support requiring utilities [...] to produce 100 percent of electricity from clean energy sources by 2050” (2019). Finally, we will increase funding for post-disaster aid. This includes programs such as “Crop Insurance”, “Economic Injury Disaster Loans”, and “Casualties, Disasters, and Theft” (Benefits.gov, 2019). The wellbeing of both people and animals is of high priority to us and as such, we will actively pursue the protection of natural spaces.</p>

			<h3 class="header"> Gun Control</h3>
			<p class="text"> Mass shootings plague the country and yet nothing seems to be happening to prevent such tragedies. According to the FBI, there were 250 separate active shooter incidents between 2000 and 2017 with 2,217 casualties (2017). In 2018 there were an additional 27 incidents with 213 casualties (FBI, 2019). There are fruitless attempts to regulate things that will not produce any useful results in the real world. As opposed to the impractical idea of regulating firearms, we will be taking a page out of the Swiss play book and focus on regulating ammunition instead. Tough assessments to obtain ammunition allow lawful gun owners to remain happy while the dangerous component of a firearm remains well regulated. We will put more rigorous checks in place to ensure those who do have access to these weapons will not be a danger to the public. These assessments will be monetised and the overall price of items will be increased. The extra money generated from this will in turn fund our Mental Health programs.</p>
