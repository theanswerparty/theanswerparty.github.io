					<td> <h3> Immigration</h3>
						<p> The world is a big place with lots of people moving from place to place. Unfortunately, current border and immigration policies have fallen behind the times. Based on times when the world was less-than-open, our immigration laws are harsh with little rationale for their details. We intend to put less aggressive border policies in place. This means a few things for the hopeful individuals that want to enter the United States. Immigrants will be able to enter the country more safely and without being harassed. In addition to this, we will provide resources for new immigrants so they can hit the ground running. Many people come to America for the American dream and we seek to facilitate that process as much as possible.</p></td>
					<td> <h3> Mental Health</h3>
						<p> Taking care of the mentally ill should be of high priority in this nation. Often, the focus is on the mitigating effects of an issue and not preventing the causes. We will provide services and aid to the people who need them at zero or reduced cost. These can include therapy, prescriptions, and methods of rehabilitation for those who need them. All people deserve to have a level of care that keeps them and the people around them safe. This will tie into our policy of Gun Control with more rigorous background checks and mental health assessments to ensure dangerous weapons do not fall into the hands of dangerous people.</p></td>

					<td> <h3> Environment</h3>
						<p> We promote clean energy and the idea that action must be taken to slow down and/or reverse the effects of climate change. This starts with tax hikes for fossil fuels and the unclean energy sector. While doing this, we will provide incentives for renewable energy and assist those in the fossil fuel industry in transitioning towards work with cleaner alternatives. Finally, we will increase funding for post-disaster aid. This includes groups such as [...]. The wellbeing of both people and animals is of high priority to us and as such, we will actively pursue the protection of natural spaces.</p></td>
					<td> <h3> Gun Control</h3>
						<p> Mass shootings plague the country and yet nothing seems to be happening to prevent such tragedies. There are fruitless attempts to regulate things that will not produce any useful results in the real world. As opposed to the impractical idea of regulating firearms, we will be taking a page out of the Swiss play book and focus on regulating ammunition instead. Tough assessments to obtain ammunition allow lawful gun owners to remain happy while the dangerous component of a firearm remains well regulated. We will put more rigorous checks in place to ensure those who do have access to these weapons will not be a danger to the public. These assessments will be monetised and the overall price of items will be increased. The extra money generated from this will in turn fund our Mental Health programs.</p></td>
