					<td> <h3> Immigration</h3>
						<p> We intend to put less aggressive border policies in place. This means that immigrants will be able to enter the country without being harassed. In addition to this, we will provide resources for new immigrants so they can hit the ground running.</p></td>
					<td> <h3> Mental Health</h3>
						<p> Taking care of the mentally ill should be of high priority in this nation. We will provide services and aid to the people who need them at zero or reduced cost. This will tie into our policy of Gun Control with more rigorous background checks and mental health assessments to ensure dangerous weapons do not fall into the hands of dangerous people.</p></td>
				</tr>

				<tr>
					<td> <h3> Environment</h3>
						<p> We promote clean energy and the idea that action must be taken to slow down and/or reverse the effects of climate change. This starts with tax hikes for fossil fuels and the unclean energy sector. While doing this, we will provide incentives for renewable energy and assist those in the fossil fuel industry in transitioning to cleaner alternatives. Finally, we will increase funding for post-disaster aid.</p></td>
					<td> <h3> Gun Control</h3>
						<p> As opposed to the impractical idea of regulating firearms, we will be taking a page out of the Swiss play book and focus on regulating ammunition instead. We will put more rigorous checks and assessments in place to ensure those who do have access to these weapons will not be a danger to the public. These assessments will be monetised and the overall price of items will be increased. The extra money generated from this will in turn fund our mental health programs.</p></td>
